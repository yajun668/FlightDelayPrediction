# Dataset
This dataset draws upon three primary sources of data for the empirical experiments. Airport classification data is obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The airline on-time performance data, encompassing all domestic flights within the U.S., is collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the U.S. Department of Transportation. This research also incorporates detailed airport-specific weather data, which we sourced from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM), administered by Iowa State University. Due to the large file size, the full dataset can be downloaded from Mendeley Data at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/j3zfnxk56h/2
